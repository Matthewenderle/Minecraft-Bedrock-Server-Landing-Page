# Minecraft Server Landing Page

Minecraft Server Landing Page is a Node.js based package used to serve basic information about a hosted Minecraft Bedrock Server.

## Features

- 📝 Documentation on how to join the server
- ⚡️ Server status (player count and game version)

## Setup

If you don't have a Minecraft Bedrock Server established already, you can follow the procedures here: [MCBedrock Setup](https://github.com/matthewenderle/mcserver-landing-page/blob/master/MCBEDROCK-SETUP.md)

You will need a few dependancies on your server in order to run this.

```bash
cd ~/
wget https://github.com/matthewenderle/mcserver-landing-page.git
```
